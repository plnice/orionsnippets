orionsnippets
=============

### Share your code snippets to various services, like Google+.

*Description:*
Orion Snippets is a plugin for Eclipse Orion that allows users to share the selection to various services.
Orion Snippets is not only a simple Orion plugin; it provides the framework-like way to attach your own services 
connectors, which means that in few steps you can make Orion share your snippets to your favourite website - thanks
to technologies like requireJS it's only a matter of specifying a simple file with one JS object and including
connector name in supplied settings file. For each connector, you will get a separate Share button in Orion editor. 
Initial version (1.0) includes Google+ connector, we plan to add Blogger connector in 1.1 version. Also, we'd 
like to encourage you to write your own connectors - it's a great fun to see how your snippets are shared everywhere you want!
